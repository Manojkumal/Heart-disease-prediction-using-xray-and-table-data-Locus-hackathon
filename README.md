# Heart-disease-prediction-using-xray-and-table-data-Locus-hackathon

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on a set of medical attributes. By analyzing various factors, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, the predictive model can provide valuable insights into potential heart disease risks.

## Dataset

The prediction model is trained on a dataset obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease. The dataset contains information about patients, including their medical attributes and whether or not they have been diagnosed with heart disease. It consists of [number of instances] instances and [number of features] features.

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is carefully examined and processed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Feature scaling and normalization techniques are applied to ensure accurate model training.
